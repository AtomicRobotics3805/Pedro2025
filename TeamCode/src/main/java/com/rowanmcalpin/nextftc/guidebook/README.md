# Commands

_What is a command?_ Commands make up one of the central features of NextFTC. A command is a small
unit of code that performs an action, such as moving a motor or servo. On top of this, **Command
Groups** are used to group actions together in different ways. 

# Subsystems

_What is a subsystem?_ A subsystem is a collection of commands and other functionality that can only
be used by one command at a time. This prevents multiple commands from, for example, moving the same
motor in different directions (which would cause an extremely fast jittering and risks damaging it).
